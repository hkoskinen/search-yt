# Search YouTube #

Search YouTube videos through its API. Made as an exercise to learn more about React
and related tools.

## Install ##

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hkoskinen/search-yt.git
cd search-yt
npm install
npm start
```

### Notes ###

Remember to add ```.env``` file at the root of the project before running npm start. After creating the file add a key REACT_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY with your YouTube API key as a value in there so it looks something like this:

```
REACT_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=<your-api-key-from-youtube-here>
```
